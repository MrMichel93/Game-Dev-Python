# AP Computer Science Principles: Game Development with Python
## Course Overview

**Target Audience:** Students ages 16-20 (Beginner to Intermediate)  
**Primary Library:** Pygame Zero  
**Duration:** 10 Modules  
**Pedagogical Focus:** Abstraction and Computational Thinking

## Course Philosophy

This course teaches foundational computer science concepts through game development, emphasizing how abstraction simplifies complex problems. Each module is explicitly aligned with AP Computer Science Principles "Big Ideas" and demonstrates how game development provides a practical context for understanding computational thinking.

## AP CSP Big Ideas Covered

1. **Creative Development** - Module 9
2. **Data** - Modules 1, 4, 6
3. **Algorithms and Programming** - Modules 2, 3, 5, 8
4. **Computer Systems and Networks** - Module 7
5. **Impact of Computing** - Module 10

## Module Structure

Each module includes:
- **Learning Objectives:** Clear, measurable goals
- **AP CSP Standards:** Explicit alignment with AP curriculum
- **Concept Lesson:** Core Python concept in game development context
- **Practice Problems:** 3 problems mixing code writing and debugging
- **Project Task:** Hands-on game element to build

## Course Progression

1. **Module 1:** Variables and Game State
2. **Module 2:** Conditionals and Game Logic
3. **Module 3:** Loops and Animation
4. **Module 4:** Lists and Sprite Management
5. **Module 5:** Functions and Abstraction
6. **Module 6:** Dictionaries and Game Data Structures
7. **Module 7:** Event Handling and User Input
8. **Module 8:** Collision Detection and Game Physics
9. **Module 9:** Game Design and Creative Development
10. **Module 10:** Game Impact and Ethics
