**Big Idea:** Algorithms and Programming (AAP)  
Organize code into reusable functions and understand abstraction as a complexity management tool.

### Module 6: Dictionaries and Game Data Structures
**Big Idea:** Data (DAT)  
Use dictionaries to organize complex game data and represent game entities.

### Module 7: Event Handling and User Input
**Big Idea:** Computer Systems and Networks (CSN)  
Implement responsive controls and understand event-driven programming.

### Module 8: Collision Detection and Game Physics
**Big Idea:** Algorithms and Programming (AAP)  
Implement collision detection algorithms and apply basic physics principles.

### Module 9: Game Design and Creative Development
**Big Idea:** Creative Development (CRD)  
Apply iterative design processes and learn how collaboration enhances game development.

### Module 10: Game Impact and Ethics
**Big Idea:** Impact of Computing (IOC)  
Examine the societal implications of games and learn to design accessible, ethical games.
